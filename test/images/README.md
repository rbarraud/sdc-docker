This directory holds the data (typically Dockerfile's) needed to
build and push docker images used by the sdc-docker test suite.
By convention, our test images are published to:
    https://hub.docker.com/u/joyentunsupported/dashboard/

These images need to be *manually* built and pushed after any changes,
before running the test suite.
